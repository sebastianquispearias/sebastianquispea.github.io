¡Hola! Hi! Olá! Hallo!

Welcome! I am an Industrial Engineer working on process improvement projects through the use of software. I have experience in both the public and private sectors. 

I've worked at Proyecto Especial Sierra Centro Sur, an entity belonging to the Ministry of Agricultural Development and Irrigation (MIDAGRI), and at HYHG CONTRATISTAS S.A.C, a company involved in the mass consumer poultry market.

Currently, I am involved in academic research related to the application of genetic algorithms at PUCP.

I completed my studies at PUC-Rio in 2021 and obtained my bachelor's degree from PUCP in 2022.
